- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidpagnon

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning in a general sense, and in particular in anything related to sports and arts. I created two widespread open-source applications for markerless motion analysis: [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) and [Sports2D](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D).

- ðŸŒ± In 2023, I completed a PhD in computer vision and biomechanics in Grenoble, France. I am now splitting my time between a post-doc research position at the University of Bath, UK, and a computer vision engineer position at [ForceTeck](https://forceteck.com/). 

- :monkey_face: Before that, I was a professional parkour artist. I am still performing part-time all over Europe.\
  See a video of [one of our performances here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUVjlUrHqXk), or a video of [me at Ninja Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm3TyZ8L9S0).
