- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidpagnon

- 👀 I’m interested in learning in a general sense, and in particular in anything related to research in sports.

- 🌱 I just completed a PhD in computer vision and in biomechanics in Grenoble, France, and am currently pursuing a post-doc in Bath, UK. \
  I'm working on markerless motion capture applied to sports.

- :monkey_face: Before that, I was a professional parkour artist. I am still performing part-time.\
  See a video of [one of our performances here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUVjlUrHqXk), or a video of [me at Ninja Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm3TyZ8L9S0).
