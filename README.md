- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidpagnon

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning anything new, especially if it has to do with sports.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m doing a PhD in computer vision and in biomechanics in Grenoble, France. 
  I'm currently working on markerless kinematics applied to sports biomechanics.

- :monkey_face: I'm also occasionally doing artistic parkour performances.
  See a video of [one of our performances here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUVjlUrHqXk), or a video of [me at Ninja Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm3TyZ8L9S0).
