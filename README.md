- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidpagnon

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning anything new, especially if it has to do with sports and research.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing a PhD in computer vision and in biomechanics in Grenoble, France. \
  I'm working on markerless motion capture applied to sports.

- :monkey_face: Before that, I was a professional parkour artist.\
  See a video of [one of our performances here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUVjlUrHqXk), or a video of [me at Ninja Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm3TyZ8L9S0).
